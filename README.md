**N-Queens Visualizer** is a visual and interactive implementation of the classic N-Queens problem, built with Python. This algorithmic puzzle consists of placing N queens on an N√óN chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other ‚Äî no same row, column, or diagonal.

This project turns the logic into an engaging visual experience, perfect for learning, teaching, or simply exploring algorithmic beauty.

**Step 2: Example of a solution**  
Once a valid arrangement is found, the board updates to display the positions of the queens:
